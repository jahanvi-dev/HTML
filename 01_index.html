    <h1> Hello, Github. </h1>

    <!-- 
    ➡️ How does a website works?
    
    💡For example,
    Let's say you are hungry, and you want to order a burger (my personal favorite). Here either you can visit a physical store or you can place 
    an order online. Let's say I want to order a burger from McDonald's. So here's how the whole procees would go :
    
    👉 First -
    I'd open my browser and search for McDonald's website via there domain name which is https://mcdindia.com/.

    👉 Second -
    Then, the server will check if that domain name exits. If it does then, 
    search results ko database se fetch karke, HTML format me browser ko send karta hai.

    👉 Third - 
    The browser displays the results,and via HTML the browser gets access to other linkes files such as CSS, JavaScript and etc...


    💡Let's understand the entire process in more detail :

    👉 1) Before jumping unto how a website works, we need to understand what technologies are required to build a website.
    A modern day interactive website consists of three basic building blocks - HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
                                                                               CSS  (Cascading StyleSheet) and
                                                                               JavaScript.  
    -->

    <!--
    👉 2) Web Hoisting?
    Website ko internet pe dalne ke liye, ek server pe host kiya jata hai.
    Server ek powerful computer hota hai jo 24x7 internet se connected hota hai. 
    Yeh server pe website ke saare files stored rehte hain like: HTML, CSS, JS and etc...                                                                  

    -->

   <!--     
    👉 3) Domain name
    It is basically the address of your website which is unique just like our home address like www.google.com.
    With domain name users can easily access your website. And is easy to remember unlink IP address. 
    -->

    <!--     
    👉 4) Web Browser
    When we type a website's URL (Uniform Resource Locator) like www.google.com. The browser will send a request to the website server
    here it's Google.
    -->

    <!--     
    👉 5) Server Response 
    Server phir request receive krta hae and website files like - HTML, CSS & JavaScript browser ko send krta hae.
    -->

    <!--     
    👉 6) Rendering
    Browser in files ko receive karke, phir device pe website ko display karta hai. 
    Pehle HTML ko parse karta hai, phir CSS apply karta hai aur phir JavaScript execute karta hai.
    -->

   <!-- ❗ For Front-end these are the only steps involved, there are two more steps involved. Which are back-end related. ❗ -->

    <!-- 
    👉 7) Back - end ( Server-side )
    Let's say website dynamic hai (like social media,(Instagram) online shopping(Myntra)), toh back-end me programming languages (like PHP, Python, Node.js) 
    aur databases (MySQL, MongoDB) use hote hain. Yeh data ko process karte hain aur dynamic content generate karte hain.
    -->

    <!-- 
    👉 8) Client-side Interaction 
    And when user website pe kuch input dete hain (form bharna, button click karna), toh yeh information server pe send hoti hai. 
    Server isse process karke, response wapas send karta hai. 
     -->


    <!--
    ➡️ What is HTML?
    HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is a markup language and not a programming language. Hypertext means ek aisa text jispe click krke hum dusri website visit kar skte hae.
    Markup language means website ke structure ko define krne ke liye tags & annotations ka use krna. HTML ek website a basic structure hota hae, basically building block 
    because other files like: CSS, JS and etc... isse se linked hoti hae. HTML ki tags & elements ki help se hum humare website ke content ko display or organize karte hae.
    HTML had many versions over the period of time, it's current version is HTML5.The one we are working on.
    -->

     
    <!-- 
    ➡️ Syntax of HTML.
    HTML syntax consits of three things: Opening tag, Content, Closing tag and all of them together forms a HTML Element. Closing tag consists of a forward slash.
    <h1>                    = opening tag

        This is content.    = content
 
    </h1>                   = closing tag
    -->               
    
    <!-- 
    ➡️ Let's talk about Meta-Tags in HTML.
    Meta-Tags hume webpage ke baare me hume additional details deti hae like the lang, version, other linked sites etc... Which is not displayed directly on the webpage.
    Let's dicuss about them in detail :

    👉 <meta charset="UTF-8">
    UTF-8 ek common character set hai jo almost saare characters ko support karta hai including emojis.

    👉 <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    Responsive web design ke liye viewport settings specify karta hai, ensuring ki page mobile devices, ipads par theek se display ho.

    👉  <meta name="description" content="This is a sample webpage.">
    Provides a additional description of the webpage. Helpful for SEO purposes.

    👉 <!DOCTYPE html>
    Tells us about the latest version of HTML. Here it indicates HTML5 version.
